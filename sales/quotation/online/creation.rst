You can add text, images, and structural elements to quotation page by dragging and dropping blocks from the pallet on the left-hand side of the screen. A table of contents will be automatically generated based on the content you add.

Advanced descriptions for each product on a quotation are displayed on the online quotation page. These descriptions are inherited from the product page in your Web shop, and can be edited there.

You can choose to allow payment immediately after the customer validates the quote by selecting a payment option on the quotation template.

You can edit the webpage of an individual quotation as you would for any web page, by clicking the **Edit** button. Changes made in this way will only affect the individual quotation.

Using Online Quotations
========================
You can share an online quotation with your customer in two ways. You can copy the URL of the online quotation, then share it with customer.

Your customer can also access their online quotations by logging into their portal, should you have one set up. Your customer can accept or reject the quotation, print it, or negotiate the terms in a chat box. You will also receive a notification in the chatter whenever the customer views the quotation.
